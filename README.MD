#### Sample Todo api built with FastAPI ( playing with it...)

As for environment manager i've used `pipenv`
To start on your local machine just run `pipenv install` and this will read the `Pipfile` contents and create a dev env.

To check the api go to `localhost:8000/docs`. Swagger it's already built in.. :D
